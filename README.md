# Distinct Happy Number Range Counter

This was largely a project simply for the purpose of allowing me to test using Rust. It has largely the same functionality as [another repo](https://github.com/jjmark15/happy-numbers) of mine.

For information on happy numbers please see [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number).

## Usage

To build the library run `cargo build`.
To test running the binary run `cargo run`.
To test running the optimised binary run `cargo run --release`.
To just install run `cargo install --path ./`.
